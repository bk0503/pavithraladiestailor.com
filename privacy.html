    <h2>Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>
      <h3>Introduction</h3>
We value the trust you place in us. That's why we insist upon the highest standards
        for secure transactions and customer information privacy. Please read the following
        statement to learn about our information gathering and dissemination practices.
Note: Our privacy policy is subject to change at any time without notice. To make sure
        you are aware of any changes, please review this policy periodically.
By visiting this Website or mobile application you agree to be bound by the terms 
        and conditions of this Privacy Policy. If you do not agree please do not use or access our Website.
By mere use of the Website, you expressly consent to our use and disclosure of your
        personal information in accordance with this Privacy Policy. This Privacy Policy 
        is incorporated into and subject to the Terms of Use.
Collection of Personally Identifiable Information and other Information
When you use our Website, we collect and store your personal information which is 
        provided by you from time to time. Our primary goal in doing so is to provide
        you a safe, efficient, smooth and customized experience. This allows us to provide
        services and features that most likely meet your needs, and to customize our Website
        to make your experience safer and easier. More importantly, while doing so we collect 
        personal information from you that we consider necessary for achieving this purpose.
In general, you can browse the Website without telling us who you are or revealing any personal 
        information about yourself. Once you give us your personal information, you are not anonymous
        to us. Where possible, we indicate which fields are required and which fields are optional. 
        You always have the option to not provide information by choosing not to use a particular 
        service or feature on the Website. We may automatically track certain information about you
        based upon your behaviour on our Website. We use this information to do internal research
        on our users' demographics, interests, and behaviour to better understand, protect and serve 
        our users. This information is compiled and analysed on an aggregated basis. This information 
        may include the URL that you just came from (whether this URL is on our Website or not),
        which URL you next go to (whether this URL is on our Website or not), your computer browser 
        information, and your IP address.We use data collection devices such as "cookies" on certain 
        pages of the Website to help analyse our web page flow, measure promotional effectiveness,
        and promote trust and safety. "Cookies" are small files placed on your hard drive that assist 
        us in providing our services. We offer certain features that are only available through the use 
        of a "cookie". We also use cookies to allow you to enter your password less frequently during a
        session. Cookies can also help us provide information that is targeted to your interests. Most 
        cookies are "session cookies," meaning that they are automatically deleted at the end of a session.
        You are always free to decline our cookies if your browser permits, although in that case you may 
        not be able to use certain features on the Website and you may be required to re-enter your password 
        more frequently during a session.
Additionally, you may encounter "cookies" or other similar devices on certain pages of the Website that are 
        placed by third parties. We do not control the use of cookies by third parties.
If you choose to buy on the Website, we collect information about your buying behaviour.
If you transact with us, we collect some additional information, such as a billing address, a credit / 
        debit card number and a credit / debit card expiration date and/ or other payment instrument details 
        and tracking information from cheques or money orders.
If you choose to post messages on our message boards, chat rooms or other message areas or leave feedback, we
        will collect that information you provide to us. We retain this information as necessary to resolve disputes, 
        provide customer support and troubleshoot problems as permitted by law.
If you send us personal correspondence, such as emails or letters, or if other users or third parties send us correspondence 
        about your activities or postings on the Website, we may collect such information into a file specific to you.
We collect personally identifiable information (email address, name, phone number, credit card / debit card / other payment 
        instrument details, etc.) from you when you set up a free account with us. While you can browse some sections of our 
        Website without being a registered member, certain activities (such as placing an order) do require registration. 
        We do use your contact information to send you offers based on your previous orders and your interests.

      <h3>Use of Demographic / Profile Data / Your Information</h3>
We use personal information to provide the services you request. To the extent we use your personal information to market to you,
        we will provide you the ability to opt-out of such uses. We use your personal information to resolve disputes; troubleshoot problems;
        help promote a safe service; collect money; measure consumer interest in our products and services, inform you about online and offline offers, 
        products, services, and updates; customize your experience; detect and protect us against error, fraud and other criminal activity;
        enforce our terms and conditions; and as otherwise described to you at the time of collection.
With your consent, we will have access to your SMS, contacts in your directory, location and device information. We may share this data with our affiliates. 
        In the event that consent to this such use of data is withdrawn in the future, we will stop collection of such data but continue to store 
        the data and use it for internal purposes to further improve our services.
In our efforts to continually improve our product and service offerings, we collect and analyse demographic and profile data about our users'
        activity on our Website.
We identify and use your IP address to help diagnose problems with our server, and to administer our Website. Your IP address is also used to 
        help identify you and to gather broad demographic information.
We will occasionally ask you to complete optional online surveys. These surveys may ask you for contact information and demographic information 
        (like pin code, age, or income level). We use this data to tailor your experience at our Website, providing you with content that 
        we think you might be interested in and to display content according to your preferences.

      <h3>Sharing of personal information</h3>
We may share personal information with our other corporate entities and affiliates. These entities and affiliates may market 
        to you as a result of such sharing unless you explicitly opt-out.

        to comply with our legal obligations, to enforce our User Agreement, to facilitate our marketing and advertising activities, 
        or to prevent, detect, mitigate, and investigate fraudulent or illegal activities related to our Services. We do not disclose
        your personal information to third parties for their marketing and advertising purposes without your explicit consent.
We may disclose personal information if required to do so by law or in the good faith belief that such disclosure is reasonably
        necessary to respond to subpoenas, court orders, or other legal process. We may disclose personal information to law enforcement 
        offices, third party rights owners, or others in the good faith belief that such disclosure is reasonably necessary to: enforce
        our Terms or Privacy Policy; respond to claims that an advertisement, posting or other content violates the rights of a third party;
        or protect the rights, property or personal safety of our users or the general public.
We and our affiliates will share / sell some or all of your personal information with another business entity should we (or our assets) plan
        to merge with, or be acquired by that business entity, or re-organization, amalgamation, restructuring of business. Should such a 
        transaction occur that other business entity (or the new combined entity) will be required to follow this privacy policy with respect
        to your personal information.
